Version 0.9 Beta - Changelog

* Rosters!
* Command and General Tabs now indicate if there are unread messages.
* Fixed bug where posts with a quotation mark (") would not log correctly
* Fixed bug where channels that individuals did not have access to would still light up
* Converted several server conections over to TCP for performance improvements
* Improved performance of the "Who's Online" feature
* Various bug fixes

Notes:
If you are running 0.8, the Who's online (and other) feature will NOT work. I have
restructured the way it works on the server making 0.8 and 0.9 not compatible.
